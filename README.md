# Sheftel_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for Data Structures, Spring 2016 - Rock, Paper, Scissors Analysis/Prediction

In this project, the user will play **Rock, Paper, Scissors** while their moves are stored and analyzed. History of moves will be stored as either a form of decision trees or as a queue. Limits to the number of moves analyzed at once will likely be used to limit the height and length of the trees or queues respectively. Options will be available to:
1. Display analysis of the user's moves.
2. Change bot's decision mode.
  * Random (1/3 probability for each)
  * Best move based on user's previous moves
  * Best move based on research prediction

(May add feature to have save file I/O for data.)
